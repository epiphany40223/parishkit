# Stewardship schedule planning increment

Branch `pr/stewardship-schedule-planning` starts from verified PR #33 merge
`ce1e95d129646bae4d3f6fe2acdb0ad8dfd7767c` on September 15, 2026.

## Scope and delivery boundary

This increment starts [BG-04](../tasks/stewardship/background-processing.md#bg-04-schedule-revision-fulfillment-and-mode-routing)
under the [controlling Phase 4 plan](../plans/stewardship/overall.md#phase-4-production-scheduling-delivery-and-notifications).
Implement the campaign-local evaluator and ordinary schedule planning,
revision/semantic identity, safe replacement/removal and coalescing contracts
together with their Admin preview and database/runtime tests. They form one
coherent scheduling outcome, not a separate PR per helper or schema change.
Reuse existing interval resolution, applied configuration, occurrence and
fulfillment owners. The normative
[schedule workflow](../specs/stewardship/background-processing/spec.md#schedule-replacement-and-removal)
controls behavior.

Deliver the bounded asynchronous activation catch-up owner in the following
increment using these shared contracts. Its multi-batch group staging and
preparation hold are a distinct interruption/recovery boundary worth reviewing
separately. Keep BG-04's mixed tasks unchecked until all their named scope is
accepted. This split does not alter acceptance criteria or release Gate 3.

BG-06 retains Family message rendering, deliverability recovery and actual
provider dispatch. BG-07 retains receipt/digest rendering and report-fact
integration. ADM-05 retains the Production activation UI. None of those later
capabilities is enabled by incomplete scheduling work. Keep the fresh-install
schema policy, restricted runtime grants and fake/disposable validation boundary.

## Execution checkpoints

- PR #33 delivery and its complete final-head/merge-group evidence are recorded
  in the [cleanup guide](stewardship-production-cleanup.md#protected-delivery).
- Repository/specification inspection is complete for the initial evaluator
  work. Implementation, tests and all three review/fix rounds remain open.
